# SlotSync
*Built at HackCMU 2025*

## 🚀 Overview

A one-page H5 + Flask app that shows who's **in class vs free right now** and recommends **study partners** from shared classes—optimized for the campus context. It nails the ultra-simple MVP: a single page that just works.

## 🎯 Inspiration

With thousands of students on campus, it's surprisingly difficult to connect with peers—especially for first-years who are still building their social networks. Yet social connections are crucial: you'll inevitably encounter group projects, collaborative assignments, and study sessions where having the right study partners makes all the difference. SlotSync bridges this gap by helping students find classmates who share their courses and are available to study together right now, fostering meaningful academic friendships and enhancing campus social life through shared learning experiences.
## 🛠 What it does

* **Live status board**: "📚 In Class" and "✅ Free Now," auto-refreshing every 30 seconds.
* **One-tap manual status**: `free / studying / help / busy / tired / social`.
* **Schedule input**: add or replace your courses (day + time range).
* **Match (study partner)**: same-class classmates who are **currently free**, ranked with simple, explainable reasons.
* **Endpoints**: `POST /add_schedule`, `GET /current_status`, `POST /update_status`, `GET /recommendations`.

## ⚡ How we built it

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS/TS (single H5 page)
- Backend: Python/Flask
- Database: In-memory (MVP), optional JSON files for persistence
- APIs: — (none required for MVP)
- Other tools: GitHub

We intentionally kept the architecture tiny for a **24h demo**: H5 served by Flask, minimal endpoints, and in-memory data for speed. This follows our plan to use **HTML/CSS/JS + Python Flask + JSON files** so we can iterate quickly and still upgrade to JSON persistence later.

## 🎨 Design

Mobile-first single page with two list columns (in-class / free-now) and a compact form for schedule input. Recommendation cards show shared classes, score, and a short reason. We prioritized **readability** and **fast scanning** for judges; responsive tweaks are included.

## 💪 Challenges we ran into

* **Time parsing & edge cases** (start==now, end==now, no classes today).
* **Field naming alignment** between front/back/algorithm to avoid "works on my machine."
* **Cold-start data** for demos (ensuring at least two users share a class and overlap free time).
* **Keeping it simple**: resisting feature creep while leaving room for growth.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

* A smooth **live status board** with 30s polling and manual status updates.
* **Explainable matching** that feels smart without heavy ML.
* Clear **API contracts** that made 3-person parallelization fast.

## 📚 What we learned

* Focusing on **context** (same campus, same classes) dramatically boosts recommendation quality.
* "Rules that feel smart" + good UX often beat over-engineering for hackathon demos.
* Small, well-scoped APIs speed up cross-role collaboration.

## 🔮 What's next for SlotSync

* **JSON persistence** (atomic writes, reload on change) and "time-travel" param `?now=` for demo replays.
* **Class connections** boosting (currently in same class / next class together).
* **Location buckets** (UC/Library/Dorm) and proximity scoring.
* Social discovery and insights (e.g., "You study best with Alice on Tuesdays") as data accumulates.
